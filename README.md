# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


# react - a reusable compoent with
-       Props
-       Array.map()
-       Key prop
-       Template literal / String interpolation

-   props :- Pass data from parent components to child components in React.
-   The Array.map():-  method is a built-in function in JavaScript that iterates over an array, applies a function (callback) to each element, and returns a new array   
    containing the results of those function calls. In React, it's commonly used to create lists of UI elements dynamically based on data in an array.

-   key prop :- The key prop is a special attribute used in React lists (like ul in our example) to specify a unique identifier for each item. This helps React efficiently       update the UI when the list changes.  <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>

-   interpolation - used in React to dynamically display data within the JSX.
